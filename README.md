## üîé Executive Summary
This report is a manual security assessment performed against a demo Acunetix web application environment for educational and training purposes. The assessment focuses on OWASP-relevant issues and documents both the verification steps and suggested fixes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Findings
The most important issues identified in the assessment include:
- **Weak Account Lockout / Brute Force Protection** ‚Äî insufficient lockout or throttling for repeated authentication attempts.  
- **Cryptographic Failures** ‚Äî insecure use or configuration of cryptographic functions (e.g., weak TLS settings, insecure storage).  
- **SQL Injection** ‚Äî injectable parameters allowing unauthorized database interactions (sanitized PoC included).  
- **Broken Access Control** ‚Äî improper restrictions allowing unauthorized actions.  
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** ‚Äî direct access to objects (files, records) without proper authorization checks.

Each finding in the report contains:
- A concise description of the vulnerability  
- Step-by-step reproduction (sanitized)  
- Evidence (screenshots / request-response snippets with sensitive data redacted)  
- Severity and business impact  
- Practical remediation recommendations
